#### Eltex module 5

### This repository will contain tasks related to Linux.

It contains 4 different folders and each folder will have its own task. Each folder has its own README file, which contains instructions for compiling and running programs, as well as the task they perform.

Below are also the objectives of each practice.

#### Practice 1

Creation of a static, dynamic library. For the dynamic library, two options for working are considered: linking at the build stage and using the library while the program is running.

#### Practice 2

Creating a simple kernel module and building it using a makefile. The module represents the possibility of using a memory area into which a string can be written and read.
